                            <p align="justify">I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the  <a href=https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science>Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href=https://www.aalto.fi/en>Aalto University</a>, leading the Aalto Data-Intensive System group (ADIS). I am also affiliated with the <a href=https://fcai.fi/>Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI)</a>, the <a href=https://www.hiit.fi/>Helsinki Institute for Information Technology
                                (HIIT)</a> and the <a href=https://instituteq.fi/qdoc/>Quantum Doctoral Pilot Programme (QDOC)</a>. My  research focuses on efficient data-intensive systems that translate data into value for decision making. The scope of my research spans across multiple layers of the data-intensive systems, from scalable machine learning systems to distributed data
                            management systems, as well as code optimization techniques. That is to answer the question “how to co-design multiple layers of the software stack to improve scalability, performance, and energy efficiency of machine learning systems”. My long-term goal is to explore and understand the fundamental connections between data management and modern machine learning systems to make decision-making more transparent, robust and efficient. Please find more details in my 
                            <a href="RS_Zhao_pub.pdf">research statement</a> and the <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/bo-zhao-believes-machine-learning-systems-will-become-like-dictionaries-everyday-tools-we-all-use-to">press coverage</a>.

                            Before joining Aalto, I was an Assistant Professor at <a href=https://www.qmul.ac.uk>Queen Mary University of London</a>, after working as a post-doctoral researcher at <a href=http://www.imperial.ac.uk/>Imperial College London</a> in the <a href=http://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk/>Large-Scale Data & Systems (LSDS) group</a> with <a href=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/prp>Prof. Peter Pietzuch</a>. Before Imperial, I was a research assistant and obtained my PhD in the <a href=https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/dbis>Databases and Information Systems Group</a> at <a href=https://www.hu-berlin.de/en>Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (HU)</a>, supervised by <a href=https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/dbis/people/matthiasweidlich>Prof. Matthias  Weidlich</a>.
                            Before HU, I worked as a student assistant at the <a href=https://www.parallel.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/home.html>Parallel Programming group</a> with <a href=https://www.parallel.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/laboratory/team/wolf/wolf.html>Prof. Felix Wolf</a> in <a href=http://www.rwth-aachen.de/>RWTH-Aachen University</a> and <a href=https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp>Technical University of Darmstadt</a>.

                            <p> <a>[About the group]</a> We conduct research on efficient data-intensive systems that translate data into value for decision making. The scope of our research spans across multiple subfields, from scalable data-centric machine learning systems to distributed data stream management systems, as well as code optimization techniques. That is to answer the question “how to co-design multiple layers of the software stack to improve scalability, performance, and energy efficiency of ML systems”. Our long-term goal is to explore and understand the fundamental connections between data management and modern ML systems to make decision-making more transparent, robust and efficient. Please find more details in our <a href="RS_Zhao_pub.pdf">research statement</a>.

 <h3>Window-based Learned Index</h3>
                             <p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=97k8aygAAAAJ&hl=en">Liang Liang</a>, Imperial College London, 20.Jun.2024, 14:00 EEST, Online</p>
                             <p><b>[Abstract]</b>
                             Learned indices have shown substantial improvements in lookup perfor- mance. With the advancement of updatable learned indices, they are partic- ularly effective in dynamic environments like stream processing. Data stream processing systems, which allow querying over sliding windows of data streams, require efficient index structures for operations such as aggregation and joins. We introduce FLIRT, a learned index specifically designed for managing in- coming streams of sequential data, such as time-series data, over a window. FLIRT utilizes a piece-wise linear model to reduce lookup times and employs a queue-assembly structure to efficiently support updates.
While FLIRT is optimized for scenarios where the search keys arrive in a spe- cific order, this requirement can be restrictive in diverse streaming environments. The need for sequential key arrivals limits FLIRT’s applicability, for instance, in settings where the order of data arrival (processing time) does not reflect the inherent order of the data events (event-time). To overcome these limita- tions and broaden the use cases, we developed SWIX, a versatile learned index designed for more generic window processing. Unlike FLIRT, SWIX accommo- dates out-of-order key insertions, thereby enhancing its utility in environments where data arrival order is unpredictable. To support its versatility, SWIX em- ploys sophisticated buffering techniques and lightweight structures that enables efficient query execution at a low cost and makes SWIX memory efficient. Our experiments demonstrate that both FLIRT and SWIX achieve excellent per- formance in their respective applications and pave the way for incorporating streaming learned indices into other operations, such as streaming joins.

 <h3>SQL2Circuits: Estimating Metrics for SQL Queries with A Quantum Natural Language Processing Method</h3>
                             <p><a href="https://valteruo.github.io/">Valter Uotila</a>, University of Helsinki, 26.Mar.2024, 14:00 EET, CS Building B322</p>
                             <p><b>[Abstract]</b>
                             Quantum computing has developed significantly in recent years. Developing algorithms to estimate various metrics for SQL queries has been an important research question in database research since the estimations affect query optimization and database performance. This work represents a quantum natural language processing (QNLP) -inspired approach for constructing a quantum machine learning model that can classify SQL queries with respect to their execution times, costs and cardinalities. From the quantum machine learning perspective, we compare our model and results to the previous research in QNLP and conclude that our model reaches similar accuracy as the QNLP model in the classification tasks. This indicates that the QNLP model is a promising method even when applied to problems that are not in QNLP. We study the developed quantum machine learning model by calculating its expressibility and entangling capability histograms. The results show that the model has favorable properties to be expressible but also not too complex to be executed on quantum hardware, for example, on the current 20-qubit quantum computer in Finland.

 <h3>Advances, challenges, and opportunities in Table Representation Learning</h3>

                             <p><b>[Abstract]</b>
The impressive capabilities of transformers have been explored for applications over language, code, images, but the millions of tables have long been overlooked while tables dominate the organizational data landscape and give rise to peculiar challenges. Unlike natural language, tables come with structure, heterogeneous and messy data, relations across tables, contextual interactions, and metadata. Accurately and robustly embedding tables is, however, key to many real-world applications from data exploration and preparation to question answering and tabular ML. In this talk, I will discuss the general approaches taken towards adapting the transformer architecture towards tables and give an overview of the tasks already explored in this space. I will zoom in on some of the shortcomings of these approaches and close with the open challenges and opportunities, and some ongoing work.

                            <p><b>[Abstract]</b> 
The recent advances in generative large language models (LLMs) are attributable to the surging number of model parameters trained on massive datasets. However, improving LLM quality by scaling up models leads to several major problems including high computational costs. Instead of scaling up the models, a promising direction, which OpenAI has recently adopted, is known as Retrieval-Augmented Language Model (RALM), which augments a large language model (LLM) by retrieving context-specific knowledge from an external database via vector search. This strategy facilitates impressive text generation quality even with smaller models, thus reducing computational demands by orders of magnitude.

However, RALMs introduce unique system design challenges due to (a) the diverse workload characteristics between LLM inference and retrieval and (b) the various system requirements and bottlenecks for different RALM configurations including model sizes, database sizes, and retrieval frequencies. In this talk, I will present Chameleon, a heterogeneous accelerator system integrating both LLM and retrieval accelerators in a disaggregated architecture. The heterogeneity ensures efficient serving for both LLM inference and retrieval, while the disaggregation allows independent scaling of LLM and retrieval of accelerators to fulfill diverse RALM requirements. Our Chameleon prototype implements retrieval accelerators on FPGAs and assigns LLM inference to GPUs, with a CPU server orchestrating these accelerators over the network. Evaluated on various RALMs, Chameleon exhibits up to 2.16× reduction in latency and 3.18× speedup in throughput compared to the hybrid CPU-GPU architecture.

                            <p><a href="https://about.yao.sh/">Xiaozhe Yao</a>, ETH Zürich, 26.Feb.2024, 14:00 EET, Online </p>
                            <p><b>[Abstract]</b> Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks can greatly improve model quality, however serving many different fine-tuned LLMs concurrently for users in multi-tenant environments is challenging. Dedicating GPU memory for each model is prohibitively expensive and naively swapping large model weights in and out of GPU memory is slow. Our key insight is that fine-tuned models can be quickly swapped in and out of GPU memory by extracting and compressing the delta between each model and its pre-trained base model. We propose DeltaZip, an LLM serving system that efficiently serves multiple full-parameter fine-tuned models concurrently by aggressively compressing model deltas by a factor of 6× to 8× while maintaining high model quality. DeltaZip increases serving throughput by 1.5× to 3× and improves SLO attainment compared to a vanilla HuggingFace serving system.

                            <h3>TempoRL: Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with Recurrent Tensors</h3>
                            <p><a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~pms20/">Pedro Silvestre</a>, Imperial College London, 19.Feb.2024, 13:00 EET, Online </p>
                            <p><b>[Abstract]</b> Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an increasingly relevant area of algorithmic research. Though RL differs substantially from Supervised Learning (SL), today's RL frameworks are often simple wrappers over SL systems. In this talk, we first analyse the differences between SL and RL from the system designer's point-of-view, then discuss the issues and inefficiencies of RL frameworks arising from those differences. In particular, we discuss how the existence
                            of cyclic and dynamic data dependencies in RL forces the decomposition of algorithms into disjoint dataflow graphs, preventing holistic analysis and optimisation.</p>

                            <p>We then propose TempoRL, a system designed to efficiently capture these cyclic and dynamic data dependencies in a single graph by instead viewing RL algorithms as Systems of Recurrence Equations (SREs). TempoRL is then able to holistically analyse and optimise this graph, applying both classic and novel transformations like automatic vectorisation (when memory allows) or incrementalisation (when memory is scarce).  Because SREs impose no control-flow, TempoRL is free to choose any execution schedule that respects the data dependencies. Luckily, by designing around SREs, we are able to leverage the powerful polyhedral analysis framework to find efficient and parallel execution schedules, as well as, compute a memory management plan through dataflow analysis. The remainder of the talk discusses the surprising advantages that this novel computational model brings, and the applications it may have outside of RL.

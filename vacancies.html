                             <p> <a>[About the group]</a> We conduct research on efficient data-intensive systems that translate data into value for decision making. The scope of our research spans across multiple subfields, from scalable data-centric machine learning systems to distributed data     stream management systems, as well as code optimization techniques. That is to answer the question “how to co-design multiple layers of the software stack to improve scalability, performance, and energy efficiency of ML systems”. Our long-term goal is to explore and understand the fundamental       connections between data management and modern ML systems to make decision-making more transparent, robust and efficient. Please find more details in our <a href="RS_Zhao_pub.pdf">research statement</a>.
